# Project Overview: Simplified Trading System

## Key Components:
- Order Gateway: Accepts and validates incoming orders from clients.
- Matching Engine: Maintains an order book (bids/asks) and executes trades by matching orders.
- Market Data Distributor: Broadcasts market data (e.g., price updates, trade notifications) to subscribers.
- Logger/Persistence Module: Asynchronously logs orders/trades via IPC or separate threads.

### Networking Concepts:

#### Socket Programming for Order Entry and Market Data:
- **Order Gateway:** Use a TCP server to listen for incoming order requests. Implement a simple custom protocol (e.g., fixed-length headers or JSON/XML messages) for order details (symbol, side, price, quantity, timestamp).

- **Market Data Distribution:** Use either TCP (for reliability) or UDP (for lower latency) to broadcast market updates.
> Boost.Asio Tutorial (or equivalent libraries in your language of choice)

#### Protocol Design & Error Handling
- Define a clear message format for order entry and market data.
- Incorporate error-checking, heartbeats, and reconnection logic to ensure robustness.

### OS Concepts:
#### Multithreading & Concurrency:
- **Order Processing:** Spawn worker threads (or use a thread pool) in the Order Gateway to handle multiple incoming connections concurrently. Each thread parses, validates, and forwards orders to the Matching Engine.
- **Order Matching:** The Matching Engine should use synchronized access (e.g., mutexes, locks) to safely update the shared order book.

#### Inter-Process Communication (IPC) & Asynchronous Logging:

- Run a separate logging process or thread to asynchronously record order/trade events without slowing down order processing.
- Use message queues or shared memory (if splitting components into processes) to communicate logs.

#### Efficient Resource Management:
- Use proper thread synchronization and minimize context switching for low latency.
- Consider using lock-free data structures if aiming for ultra-low latency.

## Putting It All Together: System Architecture
### Order Gateway (Network + OS):
#### Function:
- Accept client connections, receive order messages.
- Parse and validate orders.
#### Implementation:
- Use a TCP server socket.
- For each connection, assign a worker thread from a pool.
#### Key Concept:
- Socket programming and multithreading.

### Matching Engine (Core Trading Logic):

#### Function:
- Maintain an in-memory order book.
- Match incoming orders against existing orders based on price/time priority.
####  Implementation:
- Use data structures like balanced trees or heaps.
- Synchronize access using mutexes.
#### Key Concept:
- Concurrency, synchronization, and efficient data management.

### Market Data Distributor (Network + OS):

#### Function:
- After an order is matched, broadcast trade execution and market updates.
#### Implementation:
- Use either a separate TCP/UDP server for market data or publish–subscribe model.
#### Key Concept:
- Socket programming with multicast or broadcast techniques.

## Logger/Persistence Module (OS + IPC):

#### Function:
- Asynchronously log orders and trades for audit purposes.
#### Implementation:
- Use a dedicated logging thread or separate process.
- Communicate via IPC (message queues, shared memory) to avoid blocking the main trading logic.
#### Key Concept:
- Asynchronous processing and IPC.
